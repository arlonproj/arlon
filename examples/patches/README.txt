This directory is for demo purposes.
It holds "patch" directories created by the Override feature
of Arlon declarative clusters.
It's placed in the same repo as examples/clustertemplates to ensure
that updates to a cluster template propagate to workload clusters that
have an override whose patch is stored here.
